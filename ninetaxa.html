    <h1>Ninetaxa</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Ninetaxa (nee-ne-<em>ta</em>-kha) is a conlang I have been working on a few years now, but I haven't actually spent anything near that amount of time working on it. Ninetaxa is also my first conlang, so it probably isn't the best, but I'm still proud of it.</p>
    <h2>Phonology</h2>
    <h3>Consonants</h3>
    <p>Ninetaxa's consonants are quite simple. The consonants are: [p], [t], [k], [b], [d], [g], [s], [z], [x], [m], [n], [Å‹], [l], [j], and [w]. Nothing too out of the ordinary.</p>
    <h3>Vowels</h3>
    <p>Ninetaxa's vowels are literally just the five vowel system. Nothing special here.</p>
